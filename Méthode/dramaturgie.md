## Keep going

Even if you’re not happy with what you’re putting out, even if your ability to execute doesn’t quite match up to your vision yet, don’t quit. This is normal. Do a lot more work and you’ll find the gap close.

## Six secrets du storytelling

https://medium.com/crowdcast-news/6-secrets-to-storytelling-from-emmy-award-winning-filmmaker-patrick-moreau-fb61dc333212#.tvwcd96f6

1. People. Who’s in the story? What do they desire? The stronger the character and their desire, the more we feel something and the better we connect to the story.
2. Places. Where does the story happen? This context is what creates trust.
3. Purpose. Why are you telling the story? Your “why” is key — this is what lets people remember your message.
4. Plot. What’s the structure of your story? A good plot is key to keeping your audience engaged.

Il n'y en a que quatre. Oui. Et d'autres conseils.


## Elmore Lonard

1/ Never open a book with weather.
2/ Avoid prologues.
3/ Never use a verb other than "said" to carry dialogue.
4/ Never use an adverb to modify the verb "said"…he admonished gravely.
5/ Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.
6/ Never use the words "suddenly" or "all hell broke loose."
7/ Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.
8/ Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.
9/ Don't go into great detail describing places and things.
10/ Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.

My most important rule is one that sums up the 10.

If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it. 


## Henry Miller

From Henry Miller's book Henry Miller on Writing.
1/ Work on one thing at a time until finished.
2/ Start no more new books, add no more new material to Black Spring. (Apparently he's giving himself this advice.)
3/ Dont be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.
4/ Work according to the program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!
5/ When you cant create you can work.
6/ Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.
7/ Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.
8/ Dont be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.
9/ Discard the Program when you feel like itbut go back to it the next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.
10/ Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.
11/ Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.

In the nov­els of Ian McE­wan, a pat­tern recurs. The main char­ac­ter makes a mis­take — just one — which then hangs over them forever. A girl misid­en­ti­fies a rap­ist, and in doing so shat­ters three lives, includ­ing her own ( Atone­ment). A man exchanges a linger­ing glance with another, who becomes a ten­a­cious stalker ( Endur­ing Love). A just-mar­ried couple fail to have sex, or rather have it badly, and aren’t them­selves again, either as indi­vidu­als or as a pair ( On Chesil Beach). Often, the mis­take rever­ber­ates over much of the 20th cen­tury.


## Georges Polti

https://newrepublic.com/article/180395/ai-artifical-intelligence-writing-human-creativityS
Tenen’s potted history of authorial hacks, the richest section of his book, begins with Georges Polti, an enterprising Frenchman who in 1895 published a book called The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations, to help dramatists write new plays.
